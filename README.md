# posterior_probability
A implementation that:

- Can determine the posterior probability of different hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations
- Can determine the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations

Programming Language used: Java
Code structure: 
1. Taking the input as argument then we compute the number of Cherry and Lime in the input 
2. We then  determine the posterior probability of different hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, 
and given a sequence of observations. 
3. We then determine the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different
 hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations. 
4. We print the output in results.txt file.

To run the code compile using : javac compute_a_posteriori.java
and execute as : java compute_a_posteriori CLLCCLLLCCL
